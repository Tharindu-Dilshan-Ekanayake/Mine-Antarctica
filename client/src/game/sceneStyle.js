/**
 * The scene's whole look in one place: a bright toy-brick world with a saturated blue
 * sky, lime studded baseplate, tan checker brick walls and orange wooden fences.
 *
 * Colours are sRGB hex, exactly as you would pick them in an image editor.
 *
 * Light intensities are three.js physical units: a light of intensity PI (~3.14)
 * lights a surface facing it to its full texture colour. The hemisphere fill plus the
 * sun add up to just over that on the ground, which is what keeps the greens vivid;
 * shadowed ground only gets the fill, so shadows read as a softer, darker green.
